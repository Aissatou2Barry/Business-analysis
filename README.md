# Zomato-s
Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |

| 2 |Business analysis| This was an autonomous project where I had to access the provided data and come up with my own inquiries and procedures for analyzing the data. Consumer study conducted by Zomato on the financial success of restaurants and service users that have enrolled. To decide what area of the three analyses—sales, restaurant, and customer—I wanted to focus on.  I start by applying the supplied data to a decomposition analysis. Then, in order to grasp the data better and give Zomato's the most intelligent analysis and advice, I examine the data and formulate the questions that must be answered. Subsequently, I created a dashboard that offers an explanation of the data in answer to every question asked. This allowed me to create a visualization that better explains Zomato's sales analysis, segmentation, customer analysis, and restaurant analysis.
